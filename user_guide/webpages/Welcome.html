The Col*Fusion name stands for Collaborative [data] Fusion. <br/>
The system is aimed to play a role of interactive data repository which is open for everyone. Everyone is welcome to provide some data in form of datasets (we also call them stories) and utilze the data already available in the system. In addition, the system leverages the crowd to build relationships between the stories.
<br/>

The help center will help you to get familiar with the system and/or find answers to some questions you might have.
